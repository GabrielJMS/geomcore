//! Analytic intersection result types.
//!
//! The `intersect_*` methods on the analytic surfaces return these enums:
//! the intersecting curve on success, or an explicit classification when
//! the pair is tangent, disjoint, parallel, or coincident. Tangency and
//! coincidence are decided with [`crate::Tolerance`], so near-degenerate
//! configurations classify robustly instead of collapsing to noise.
