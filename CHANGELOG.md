# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). The Rust crate and
the Python distribution are versioned in lockstep.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.7.0] - 2026-09-29

### Added

- Analytic intersections, Stream 2 batch 2: `Plane::intersect_cylinder`
  (→ circle / ellipse / two lines / tangent line / empty),
  `Plane::intersect_cone` (→ circle / ellipse / parabola / hyperbola
  branch / two apex lines / tangent generator / apex point / empty, with
  single-nappe filtering), and `Line3D::intersect_plane/sphere/cylinder/
  cone` (→ ordered hits with parameters, tangent, single transversal
  hit, empty, coincident). A shared tolerance-aware quadratic solver
  classifies by root separation, so grazing contact is robust across
  scales. Python returns `(kind, payload)` tuples throughout.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-09-29

### Added

- Analytic intersections, Stream 2 batch 1: `Plane::intersect_plane`
  (→ `Line3D`, direction = n1 × n2, with `Parallel`/`Coincident`
  classification), `Plane::intersect_sphere` and
  `Sphere::intersect_sphere` (→ `Circle3D`, with
  `TangentPoint`/`Empty`/`Coincident` classification). Near-degenerate
  configurations classify by `Tolerance` instead of collapsing to noise.
  Python returns `(kind, payload)` tuples, e.g. `("line", Line3D)`,
  `("tangent_point", Point3D)`, `("empty", None)`.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-09-29

### Added

- Closed-form point projection: `project_point(point, tol)` and batch
  `project_points(points, tol)` on `Line3D`, `Circle3D`, `Line2D`,
  `Circle2D` (returning `CurveProjection { parameter, distance }`) and on
  `Plane`, `Cylinder`, `Cone`, `Sphere`, `Torus` (returning
  `SurfaceProjection { u, v, distance }`). Sub-tolerance distances snap
  to `0.0`, so projection agrees with `contains`. Python returns
  `(parameter, distance)` / `(u, v, distance)` tuples.
  (Conic and B-spline projection arrive with the `math` foundations.)

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-29

### Added

- Point containment: `contains(point, tol)` on all analytic surfaces
  (`Plane`, `Cylinder`, `Cone`, `Sphere`, `Torus`), verified by
  inverse-parameter re-evaluation against `tol.confusion`.
  Python: `contains(point, tol=None)`.
  (`BSplineSurface` containment arrives with numeric projection.)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-29

### Added

- Public `Tolerance` API (`confusion`, `angular`, `parametric`, with
  `Tolerance::DEFAULT` matching the kernel's historical internal values);
  internal tolerances now derive from it. Python: `geomcore.Tolerance`.
- Point containment: `contains(point, tol)` on all analytic curves
  (`Line3D`, `Circle3D`, `Ellipse3D`, `Parabola3D`, `Hyperbola3D`,
  `Line2D`, `Circle2D`), verified by inverse-parameter re-evaluation
  against `tol.confusion`. Python: `contains(point, tol=None)`.
  (`BSplineCurve3D` containment arrives with numeric projection.)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-29

### Changed

- **Breaking:** renamed value and placement types for `2D`/`3D` consistency
  with the curve names: `Point2` → `Point2D`, `Point3` → `Point3D`,
  `Vector2` → `Vector2D`, `Vector3` → `Vector3D`, `Axis2` → `Axis2D`,
  `Axis3` → `Axis3D`, `Frame2` → `Frame2D`, `Frame3` → `Frame3D`
  (Rust and Python).
- **Breaking (Python):** geometric objects are now constructed with
  `__init__` only (e.g. `Circle3D(Point3D.origin(), Vector3D.z(), 2.0)`);
  the duplicate `.new()` staticmethods were removed.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- Parametric evaluation (point, first and second derivatives, bulk
  `eval_points`) for lines, circles, ellipses, parabolas, hyperbolas, and
  B-spline curves (rational and periodic) in 3D, plus 2D lines and circles.
- Parametric evaluation for planes, cylinders, cones, spheres, tori, and
  B-spline surfaces.
- Rigid transformations (translation, rotation, mirroring, scaling) via a
  single `Transform` type, applicable to all geometry.
- Analytic curve-on-surface parametrization for lines and circles on the five
  elementary surfaces (plane, cylinder, cone, sphere, torus).
- Python bindings (`pip install geomcore`) with native `geomcore.curves` and
  `geomcore.surfaces` submodules, for Python 3.9+ (abi3).
- Golden-fixture validation of all numeric results at 1e-7 tolerance, and
  criterion throughput benchmarks (`docs/benchmarks.md`).
